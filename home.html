    It is called rock climbing. </p>
  <p>
    While the concept of rocks and differences in height might seem novel to the dutch, these are in fact things that exist.</br>
    If you combine both of those concepts, and you try and get up that combined concept, then you get rock climbing.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is a bit like the dutch sport Fierljeppen, except instead of a ditch, to get over, you have a rock, to get onto, and instead of a pole, you use your hands.
